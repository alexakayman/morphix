Web scraping kind of sucks, even the no-code tools. No one wants to define schemas or click on elements on a page over and over again.

What if there was a different way? A better way? A lazier way. . .

### âœ¨ Introducing Morphix

My latest late-night weekend side project. Here's how it works:

1. Define your fields
2. Submit a link, any link
3. The program extracts all HTML content
4. The program absorbs your fields and uses GPT-3.5 to extract accurate data
5. Rinse & repeat on different sites without defining HTML elements!

### About

**Why Morphix?**
"Morph" refers to the process of transformation or change, while "fix" implies stability or resolution. Together, Morphix transforms your data into a stable, readable state. 

### Known Issues
1. Deleting a field after data has been generated will refresh the results table, deleting all results.
2. Adding a new link & collecting results after some results have already been generated may result in uneven tables. Add all of the links at once & then export.
